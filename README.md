# rock-paper-scissors
A project for The Odin Project's Foundations Course. <strike>This is just a simple JS implementation embedded in HTML for now, and there is no front end yet.

To play and see the game results, open the browser's Developer Tools (Ctrl + Shift + I) and view on the console.</strike>

<strong>Update 02/09/2021:</strong> Added a barebones buttons-based UI in HTML as I have gone a bit further through the course. No longer need to open Dev Tools. Will make a proper shiny design next.
